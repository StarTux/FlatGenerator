# FlatGenerator

Generate a flat world at sea level. The layers will be filled as
follows:

- Layer 0: Bedrock
- Layers 1-47: Stone
- Layers 48-62: Dirt
- Layer 63: Grass Block

This makes all the 16 sided chunk cubes at and below sea level solid,
with the blocks one would expect in a survival world.
